# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository.
To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR or open an Issue.

## Setup your developer Environment

To get started with the project, run `yarn install` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn install
```

If you're developing on native iOS code, also make sure to install `swiftlint`:

```sh
brew install swiftlint
```

### Project structure overview

This repository contains 2 main projects:

* SDK project (in the `packages` folder), which consists of the following workspaces:
    * `codepush`: an integration for the [react-native-code-push](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push) library.
    * `core`: the core React Native SDK allowing tracking of logs, spans and RUM events.
    * `react-native-apollo-client`: an integration for the [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/integrations/react-native/) library.
    * `react-native-navigation`: an integration for the [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) library.
    * `react-native-webview`: an integration for the [`react-native-webview`](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview) library.
    * `react-navigation`: an integration for the [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) library.
* Sample app project (in the `example` folder)

The sample app project exists as dedicated project, because the React Native tooling, the `Metro` bundler specifically, [doesn't support symbolic links](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1), and symbolic links are used by the [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to have a single place for hosting `node_modules`.

Workspaces are managed with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

If you are using Visual Studio Code, please make sure to set workspace version of TypeScript instead of the native Typescript bundled with Visual Studio, check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39676463/3222695) to see how to do it.

### Native Module development

To edit the Objective-C and Swift files, open `example/ios/DdSdkReactNativeExample.xcworkspace` in XCode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > DdSdkReactNative`.

Make sure your code complies with the linter by running `yarn lint:ios --fix`.

To edit the Kotlin files, open `example/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `ddsdkreactnative` under `Android`.

#### With the new React Native architecture

You can find an app ready for developing with the new architecture under `example-new-architecture/`.

Create a `ddCredentials.js` file at the root of the app containing your datadog credentials:

```js
export const APPLICATION_ID = '<APP_ID>';
export const CLIENT_TOKEN = '<CLIENT_TOKEN>';
export const ENVIRONMENT = '<ENVIRONMENT>';
```
### Command line tools

You can run the samples, linters and test using the following commands: 

```sh
# Run the Unit Tests
yarn test

# Run the linter
yarn lint

# Run a command for the particular workspace (ex. @datadog/mobile-react-native)
yarn workspace @datadog/mobile-react-native <command>
```

### Example App

The `example` folder contains a sample React Native application used to develop and test the SDK.

To run it properly, you need to create a `example/src/ddCredentials.js` file with the following content:

```javascript

export const APPLICATION_ID = "<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>";
export const CLIENT_TOKEN = "<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>";
export const ENVIRONMENT = "<YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME>";
```

You can then run the sample app using the following commands (from `example` folder, make sure to do `yarn install` before):

```sh
# Run the Android sample
yarn android

# Run the ios sample
yarn ios
```

## Releasing

To bump your SDK version, run the following command, where `x.y.z` is the new version you want to set:

```sh
./update-version x.y.z
```

This bumps the versions in the `lerna.json` and related `package.json` files, and commits them.

To publish the packages, run the following command:

```sh
yarn run lerna publish from-package
```

This publishes the packages and also adds updated `gitHead` to the corresponding `package.json` files.

### How to test before shipping?

#### For iOS, run `make test-for-release`. If it doesn't work, read below

1. `cd path/to/dd-sdk-reactnative && yarn workspace @datadog/mobile-react-native pack`
    * this creates a tarball from your local & unpublished package
2. `cd {some other folder} && react-native init SomeAppName --version 0.63.4 && cd SomeAppName`
3. `npm install --save path/to/dd-sdk-reactnative/packages/core/{tarball that npm pack created}`
    * this installs the unpublished version of `@datadog/mobile-react-native` **from your local**
 
If for some reason `yarn pack` doesn't work, you can do the workaround below after creating `SomeAppName`:

1. `yarn install --save path/to/dd-sdk-reactnative/packages/core`
2. `open node_modules` and remove symlink to `@datadog/mobile-react-native`
3. copy the real `@datadog/mobile-react-native` folder to `node_modules`
    * `react-native` doesn't support symlinks and JS engine gives `unresolved module: @datadog/mobile-react-native` when you import it in your JS code

Now you can proceed to `/ios`:

1. `cd ../ios && open SomeAppName.xcworkspace`
2. make the changes below in `Podfile` and run `pod install`

```
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

# and disable Flipper related lines
```
**NOTE:** You do **NOT** need to add `DdSdkReactNative` here manually, `pod install` should find and install it automatically

Now you can go back to your `App.js/tsx` and use `@datadog/mobile-react-native` from there
Example code:
```
import { DdSdkReactNative, DdSdkReactNativeConfiguration } from '@datadog/mobile-react-native';

const App: () => React$Node = () => {
  const config = new DdSdkReactNativeConfiguration(
    "<CLIENT_TOKEN>",
    "<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>",
    "<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>",
    true, // track User interactions (e.g.: Tap on buttons)
    true, // track XHR Resources
    true // track Errors
  )
  DdSdkReactNative.initialize(config);
  ...
```

Then your project should work without problems ✅ 

If it doesn't, you should fix it before shipping ❌
