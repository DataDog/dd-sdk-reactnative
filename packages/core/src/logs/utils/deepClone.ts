/**
 * Simple deep clone inspired from https://github.com/angus-c/just/blob/master/packages/collection-clone/index.cjs
 * Functions and RegExp will be returned as they are.
 * Maps and Sets are cloned even though they won't be accepted by React Native, just in case they are mutated by the user to avoid side effects.
 *
 * We added support for circular references by limiting the number of depth levels to 8.
 * @param originalObject
